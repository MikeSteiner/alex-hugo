The applications developed by our department were based on the REST
architecture. Database management system used was MSSQL and the backend
business logic was developed using Java Spring Boot. Data exchange
between the front-end and backend part parts was based on RESTful web
services in JSON format. Angular 4 was used as a front-end application framework.


All ongoing projects were flowing the Agile development
methodologies in particular using SCRUM. Software tool used was JIRA.
Continuous integration was supported mainly by Jenkins automation server.

My main task was developing new features and bug fixing in the front-end part of applications using Angular 4 and RESTful web services in JSON format.
